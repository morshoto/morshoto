Hi everyone. I would call myself a Machine Learning engineer and so I am good at analyzing massive data and estimating its value. In the machine learning field, I am capable of visualizing data with matplotlib, using a machine learning model to estimate its value with Tensorflow, the same estimation with different libraries, Keras, and performing our project on a web application with Flask and streamlit. I am capable of Python, C++, and Java, but I mostly use Python for this project, but I have the capability to use other two languages if I need to. I am interested in following fields; Machine Learning, Data Science, Web Application, Cybersecurity & information security, Automation.
